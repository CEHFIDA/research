# Subzero
❄️  Work-in-progress development of the _cool_ new SubFinder core API `V2`

# Why?
`V1` of SubFinder's core API is actually not that bad. However, I decided I would try and re-work the design to attempt to improve it. The main motivating factor being to simplify the boilerplate to add new subdomain enumeration sources and utilize the `interface` type in golang.
