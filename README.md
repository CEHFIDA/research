# Subzero
❄️  Research project for the development of [SubFinder](https://github.com/subfinder/subfinder) core API `v2`

#### Run Tests
```shell
$ cd /path/to/research
$ go test -v -run=. ./...
# just core
$ go test -v -run=. ./core
```

# Why?
That's a great question! Hopefully these reasons will make sense:

* Reduce boilerplate code needed to add or develop new sudomain `Sources`
* Utilize the [`interface`](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces) type in golang to define our internal API semantics.
* Provide tests and examples of all its functionality.
* Ensure a solid foundation for future tools to be built upon (CLI, HTTP/REST API)
